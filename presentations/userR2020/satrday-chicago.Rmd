# What is dittodb?
  * Let's you record mock database responses
  
---
  
# What I've learned developing it
  * CI is super important
    - But also a royal pain for dbs
  * You don't have to test a full path, sometimes up to a query is enough.
    - Two paths:
      - record and then reply
      - verify calls are called (and how they are called)
